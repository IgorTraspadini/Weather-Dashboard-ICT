# Weather Dashboard
## About the Project
In this Challenge, you'll create an app that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing.

Here are the requirements:
- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
  - The city name
  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity
  - The wind speed
- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity
- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
